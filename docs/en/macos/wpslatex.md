# WPS

::: warning Important
Because WPS on macOS does not provide an AppleScript automation interface, there is no good solution yet.

Currently, macOS WPS can only insert formulas as LaTeX code, such as `$E=mc^2$` and `$$formula$$`, which must be converted manually.

Below is a quick guide to convert LaTeX to professional formula formatting in WPS.

We may provide a WPS macro for batch conversion in the future.

## Manual Formula Conversion

1. After pasting, select the LaTeX code formula text, including `$...$` or `$$...$$`.
   For example:

   `$E = mc^2$`

   `$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx$$`

2. In the menu bar, choose "Insert" -> "Formula". The text will be wrapped by the formula editor.
3. Click the wrapped LaTeX code and open the dropdown arrow on the right
4. Select "Convert to Professional"
5. The LaTeX code is converted to a professional formula display

Sorry that macOS WPS cannot auto-convert formulas yet. Thanks for understanding.
